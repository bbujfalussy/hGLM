In this directory I collect python scripts to simulate a L23 cell with complex spatio-temporal synaptic inputs. The model is based on Tiago Branco's original model developped to repreoduce dendritic spikes recorded in vivo by Spencer Smith from Mike Hausser's lab.

Has been tested only on Mac. Neuron should be installed as a python module following http://labrigger.com/blog/2012/08/30/getting-neuron-to-run-on-os-x-with-python-support/

mainAll.py: python script controlling the simulations
libcell.py: parameters of the biophysical model
init_params.py: parameters of the input and additional parameters of the simulation

Note that for in vivo-like stimuli, inputs must be provided as separate external data files for excitatory and inhibitory inputs with 2 columns [synapse number and spike time (in ms)] in a text file.

Currently only a minimal working example is provided with a 2s-long input pattern and single orientation (instead of 48s with 16 orientations), and 2 repetitions. Longer input patterns can be generated by the R script in the Inputs main directory.

Further description of the model and its usage is coming soon...
